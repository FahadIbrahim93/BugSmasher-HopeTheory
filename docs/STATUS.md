The numeric CI baseline below remains the last fully re-verified gate set (2026-08-30). Tip commits above are documentation + layout; full CI on tip should be checked in Actions before claiming new coverage numbers.

## Current verified state

The P0 emulator-test defect (P0-CI-01) is fixed and verified: the monotonic-score fixture uses a plausible score for a fresh session and the full emulator suite passes. GitHub Actions on `main` @ `bbc7250` is GREEN (CI, CodeQL, Security Audit). The same gates were independently re-run locally on the exact commit on 2026-08-30 with identical results.

### Resolved since previous baseline

- P0-CI-01: emulator regression test fixed and verified (26/26).
- P0-CI-02: full gate suite green on the exact `main` commit (GitHub Actions + local re-run).

## Current P0/P1 direction

1. Eliminate static-analysis and React correctness debt (910 ESLint warnings → 0; CQ-01/CQ-02/CQ-03).
2. Bring the tree Prettier-clean and gate formatting in CI (CQ-05).
3. Raise coverage toward the 85/85/85/75 targets (T-01), especially branch coverage.
4. Harden competitive-integrity validation (S-04/S-05).
5. Certify performance and accessibility with evidence (PERF-01..04, AX-01..05).
6. Verify deployment and operations; real providers or explicit de-scope for monitoring/ads/monetization stubs (OPS-01..06).
7. Establish repository governance/protection (P0-GOV-01 — requires GitHub settings access).
8. Keep documentation synchronized with actual evidence.
9. Perform final adversarial release audit.

## Important truth rules

- Server-issued score-session protection already exists with user binding, expiry, one-time use, replay rejection and plausibility checks.
- That mechanism is strong session/nonce validation, not full deterministic replay verification.
- Production analytics, monetization, ads, monitoring and telemetry must be called real only after provider configuration and verification.
- Historical verification files are snapshots, not current truth.
- README metrics must never outrun CI evidence.

## Documentation control plane

- `docs/PROJECT_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` — how the multi-agent project is managed.
- `AGENTS.md` — coding/architecture rules.
- `TASKBOARD.md` — live work queue and acceptance criteria.
- `docs/RELEASE_CERTIFICATION.md` — 10/10 release gates.
- `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — context-transfer record.
- `docs/STATUS.md` — current verified state.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — current architecture.
- `docs/AGENTIC_WORKFLOW.md` — agent operating procedure.

## Resume rule

After a context switch, read `STATUS.md`, then `TASKBOARD.md`, then inspect the latest GitHub Actions run. Resume the highest-priority unresolved task. Do not restart from memory.

## Certification rule

Do not change the certification state to PASS until `docs/RELEASE_CERTIFICATION.md` is fully satisfied on the exact release commit.
