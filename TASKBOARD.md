# BugSmasher — Live 10/10 Taskboard

**Last updated:** 2026-09-26  
**Certification:** NOT CERTIFIED  
**Active track:** `enterprise-10-10-revamp` → [docs/ENTERPRISE_REVAMP.md](./docs/ENTERPRISE_REVAMP.md)  
**Current state:** strong engineering baseline; last fully verified CI on `main` @ `bbc7250` is GREEN (CI + CodeQL + Security Audit).

Read first: [Enterprise Revamp](./docs/ENTERPRISE_REVAMP.md) · [Project Operating System](./docs/PROJECT_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md) · [Release Certification](./docs/RELEASE_CERTIFICATION.md) · [Current Status](./docs/STATUS.md) · [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)

## Operating rules

- One primary task ID per implementation branch/PR.
- P0 work before discretionary P1/P2 work.
- A task is `[x]` only with acceptance evidence.
- Never lower a test/security threshold to manufacture a pass.
- Never delete a regression test to hide a defect.
- Never claim a provider/integration is production-ready while it is a stub.
- Documentation must follow verified repository state.

**Legend:** `[ ]` open · `[~]` partial · `[x]` verified done · **P0** release blocker · **P1** high · **P2** medium · **P3** optional
